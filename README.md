# Probability Calculator

Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls.  
What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls?  

In this application, you can put different balls inside the hat.  
By pulling random number of balls from the hat you can calculate the probability of that the draw contains the balls you expected to draw.
